# DA-Excel_Dashboard
This dashboard project explores data science job listings through an Excel-based analysis. Built using a real-world dataset of over 32,000 job postings, the dashboard provides comparative views of job roles, salaries, work types, and locations. The primary goal of this project is to apply and reinforce core Excel skills—including **formulas, functions, data validation, data cleaning, and visualization**—in a practical context.
